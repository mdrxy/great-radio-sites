## Info

I'm the station manager for [WBOR - Bowdoin College](https://wbor.org/) and built our current website. I like looking at other stations' websites for inspiration.

### Data Sources

So far I've reviewed [this list](https://github.com/xehl/campus-fm/blob/e560046ecf665344a92d2260a9bdab5f20e5711f/src/stations.js) in addition to the (now-removed) #share-your-station channel on [AzuraCast](https://www.azuracast.com/)'s Discord server.

### Contributing

This repo is meant to serve as a list of my personal favorites. In that sense, I encourage you to fork a copy of your own.

If there is a particular station you'd like me to consider, I encourage you to open an issue.
